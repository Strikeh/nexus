                require any person or company in the United States (and
                conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting
                Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to
                post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly

                old, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts
                parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States’
                consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which
                spells out what operators of websites and online services must

                We do not specifically market to children under the age of 18

                The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of
                privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include
                have played a significant role in the development of data
                protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair
                Information Practice Principles and how they should be
                implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws
                that protect personal information.
              </p>
              <h3 class="title title-md tc-primary">
                In order to be compliant with Fair Information Practices we will
                take the following responsive action, should a data breach
                occur:
              </h3>
              <p>We will notify you via email</p>

              </ul>
              <p>
                We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires
                that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable
                rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere
                to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals
                have enforceable rights against data users, but also that
                individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to
                investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
