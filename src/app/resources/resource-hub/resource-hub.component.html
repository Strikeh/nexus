                The Nexus architecture is designed as a seven-layered software
                stack that includes a 64-bit register-based process virtual
                machine. Each layer is designated to carry out a specialized
                process independently of one another, providing additional
                functionality to the existing Internet stack, the OSI model.

                    various technologies from AR/VR to mobile interfaces. Our
                    official Interface Layer, provides a platform for developers

                    This is the first layer of the developer application space
                    which forms the logic of most applications. This layer
                    interacts directly with the API below it, and provides
                    functionality that does not depend on direct access to the
                    blockchain.

                    An example of this could be simple requests such as: ‘Send a

                    We postulate that in the future this layer will also be
                    driven by AI systems.

                    This layer provides an interface that allows developers to
                    gain direct access to blockchain functionality. It is based
                    on a simple verb and noun semantics, and accepts a wide
                    variety of encoding. It is the gateway into the blockchain,
                    that can be used without direct access to the lower levels

                    Operations are instructions or actions that give registers
                    context, and define more complex contract logic. A contract
                    is an object containing: a register pre-state (the register
                    that is being operated on that was passed upwards from the
                    Register Layer), a primitive operation (only one primitive
                    operation per contract), and a set of conditions (any amount
                    of conditional operations).
                  </p>

                  <div class="tc-info">Primitive Operations:</div>
                  <p>
                    The current iteration of the Operations Layer contains 16
                    primitive operations, and 54 conditional operations and
                    types. The primitive operations can be best described as the
                    actions taking place on the register such as: WRITE, DEBIT,
                    TRANSFER, APPEND, etc. These actions themselves cause the
                    register to change its state in some way or form, including
                    its movement from one signature chain to another.
                  </p>

                  <div class="tc-info">Conditional Contracts:</div>
                  <p>
                    Conditional Contracts are an agreement between participating
                    parties, outlining a set of requirements that must be met
                    for a transaction to complete. They are the building blocks
                    that allow users to engage with one another, such as
                    contract expiration, or the exchanging of items. More
                    advanced forms of non-custodial escrow or arbitration are
                    also possible. Conditional statements have no limit to their
                    complexity, being capable of handling groups of groups of
                    conditions that together evaluate to either true or false.
                    In the case the conditions return true, this allows the
                    recipient of the transaction to claim their funds or object
                    (depending on if this was a TRANSFER or DEBIT). In the case
                    that the recipient is unable to satisfy the conditions,
                    after a period of time set by the sender, the transaction
                    will be redeemable.

                    A register is the fastest storage medium inside your
                    computer’s CPU (Central Processing Unit), that the processor
                    uses to cache data in between calculations. This has become
                    a more desirable architecture for computer design as an
                    improvement to a much older architecture called a ‘stack’.

                  <p>
                    Nexus Registers are a data storage system that maintain an
                    immutable record and history, including current and previous
                    states, therefore they can be used to record the state of
                    applications.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The ownership of a register can be transferred between
                    Sigchains, and thus perform as Assets, Tokens or simple
                    objects, such as a crypto kitty. A register can also be
                    owned by a token, creating partial ownership of the asset it
                    represents. The Register Layer consists of three main
                    components: Object Registers, State Registers, and a 64-bit
                    Register Based Virtual Machine for condition execution.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Every register on the Nexus blockchain has two main
                    properties: An address (referred to as a register address)
                    which is used to determine the location of the data in the
                    register database, and an owner, which is the genesis hash
                    of the Signature Chain that currently owns the register.

                  <div class="tc-info">Object Registers:</div>
                  <p>
                    Object Registers are programmable type-safe objects recorded
                    with a predetermined structure which describes an asset,
                    token, or programmer’s object. They can be used for a wide
                    variety of purposes including company shares, digital
                    assets, certificates, data files, and accounts. Data fields
                    inside the object carry specifiers that define whether the
                    field can be mutable, making the object itself able to
                    enforce certain fields to have read-only or write access.

                    The above example displays a meta-data format for a
                    photographic asset that is stored in a programmable object
                    register. This format can be augmented with mutable and
                    immutable type specifiers, meaning that a field such as
                    ‘Image Title’ in the example above, could be mutable and
                    able to be modified, while the other fields would remain
                    immutable.

                  <div class="tc-info">State Register:</div>
                  <p>
                    A state register is a simple register that can store data in
                    any sequence without an enforced format by the Ledger. These
                    would be used by a Dapp to record an immutable state. State
                    Registers have two forms: RAW and APPEND. A RAW register is
                    bound by its initial size, and can be written to at any
                    time, while an APPEND register can only have data appended
                    to its state, keeping the original contents immutable.

                  <div class="tc-info">Virtual Machine:</div>
                  <p>
                    Conditional Statements are processed on top of the Virtual
                    Machine which uses 64-bit registers to maintain the state of
                    temporary condition variables as they are processed. The VM
                    increases the efficiency of conditional statements, as it
                    doesn’t carry the overhead of ‘pushing and popping’ from the
                    stack as do other VMs. This part of the Register Layer is
                    responsible for the incredible speed of conditional
                    execution, requiring only 50 nanoseconds on average per
                    instruction.

                    The Ledger is responsible for ensuring all data is formed
                    under consensus and is immutable by nature. It manages
                    ownership between parties using cryptographic primitives
                    such as hashing, digital signatures, and consensus
                    protocols. It is composed of signature chains for user-level
                    states, and the proposed architecture of the
                    Three-Dimensional Chain (3DC) for the global state, the
                    latter of which is under development through the TAO
                    framework.
                  </p>
                  <div class="tc-info">Signature Chains:</div>
                  <p>
                    A Signature Chain is a decentralized blockchain account that
                    allows you to login from any computer with a username,
                    password, and pin, without the need for wallet.dat files or
                    constantly rescanning the database. They are comparable to a
                    personal blockchain that allows decentralized access through
                    the login system, removing the need to store private keys.
                    Sigchains deterministically create a mathematical 'lock'
                    that only your login credentials can unlock.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Fundamentally, a Signature Chain decouples the private key
                    from the account, therefore one is not bound by possession
                    or security of this single private key. The private key
                    becomes obsolete when the next transaction is generated,
                    producing higher levels of security compared to the
                    continual reuse of a private key, as is the case with other
                    blockchain technologies. Other benefits come from the
                    efficiency gained by reducing the requirement of storing a
                    large amount of signatures on disk, and the ability to use a
                    variety of key types such as FALCON for increased Quantum
                    Resistance.

                  <div class="tc-info">Consensus:</div>
                  <p>
                    Two Proof of Work (PoW) channels (Prime and Hashing) and one
                    Proof of Stake (PoS) channel are used to secure the network.
                    Consensus is balanced between all three channels as it is
                    based on collective chain weight, providing a higher
                    resistance to 51% attacks compared to single algorithm
                    blockchains. As the TAO framework is developed, these three
                    forms of consensus will become the three layers of the 3DC.

                  <div class="tc-info">Reputation:</div>
                  <p>
                    Nexus implements a reputation mechanism called ‘Trust’ that
                    records the consistent time that a node contributes to the
                    validation process. Trust decreases three times faster than
                    it accrues and translates into a variable stake reward of
                    between 0.5% to 3% per annum. Trust also benefits the
                    Network Layer, where nodes can determine the reputation or
                    reliability of the nodes they are talking to, increasing
                    security against Sybil Attacks

                    The Network is responsible for the end-to-end communication
                    between nodes, handling the relaying and receiving of ledger
                    level data. Nexus augments this layer by using ‘overlays’
                    which provide IPv6 functionality to the network, which
                    allows the user to control their IP address through

                    the overlay functions as a layer of ‘elevated trust’ to the

                A major benefit of using cryptocurrencies is the security gained
                through the use of public key cryptography. Though this is a
                vast improvement to centralized login systems, this benefit
                comes with the drawback of key management. In order to manage
                keys, most cryptocurrency wallets use a database storage file
                called a ‘wallet.dat’ that keeps a record of all the keys that
                have been / will be used to access coins. We believe that the
                adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology will always
                be limited if relying on such a model, due to the inconvenience
                of having to make regular wallet backups, loss or theft of hard
                drives, and the risk of sending funds to unspendable addresses.
                These systems are susceptible to human error, boding for the
                need for complex hardware designed specifically to store private
                keys securely. Though these devices are a step towards user
                friendliness, they are still at risk of being lost or stolen,
                and therefore are not a reliable replacement for authorization
                systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                Therefore, we have automated the management of keys via a
                decentralized login system we call Signature Chains. This allows
                you to log in to your Nexus Wallet simply through a Username,
                Password and PIN. Signature Chains still use public key
                cryptography, but rather than maintaining the keys on disk or
                the cloud, they are stored in ‘mathematical hyperspace’ meaning
                that your credentials become the 'key' to a 'virtual space' that
                you own with a Signature Chain. This also removes the burden of
                key management when using DApps, which often require third party
                plugins such as MetaMask. Signature Chains decouple the private
                key from the user account, therefore one is unbound by the
                possession or security of a single private key. The private key
                becomes obsolete when the next transaction is generated,
                producing higher levels of security compared to the continual
                reuse of a private key, as is the case with other blockchain
                technologies. Signature Chains (Sigchains) are comparable to a
                'personal Blockchain', and provide the foundation for DApps that
                manage all types of digital property. They integrate into
                existing application frameworks that already rely on
                authorization systems through username and password
                combinations, and thereby provide DApp developers the ability to
                integrate blockchain functionalities as an elevated layer into
                existing applications with minimal architectural modification.
                They can also be integrated with various security measures such
                as biometrics and hardware password managers. Additional
                benefits are the efficiency gained by reducing the requirement
                of storing a large amount of signatures on disk, and the ability
                to use a variety of key types such as FALCON for increased
                Quantum Resistance.

                      Sigchains use an account based model that replaces the
                      clunky UTxO (Unspent Transaction Output) architecture that
                      Bitcoin introduced. Sigchains contain all user data on a
                      unique chain, and provide higher levels of scalability, as
                      only one signature is required to be verified per
                      transaction.

                    <p>
                      Along with Sigchains, Nexus transactions are decoupled
                      from the block, which means that only a single hash or
                      ‘proof’ per transaction is required in the block level
                      data, rather than the entire transaction itself. This
                      results in the accommodation of approximately 31,728
                      transactions per 2 MB block. Together, these innovations
                      produce lightweight blocks and efficient transaction
                      processing, without the requirement of off chain (Layer 2)
                      scaling solutions.

                      UTxO is an architecture envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto in
                      the Bitcoin whitepaper under Section 9, ‘Splitting and
                      Combining Value’ [<a
                        href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf"
                        >Bitcoin Whitepaper</a
                      >]. In this architecture, outputs contain a given value,
                      such as 0.5 BTC, which then become inputs to another. The
                      following diagram illustrates this model:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      These outputs are then ‘split and combined’ into more
                      outputs in the next transaction as shown in the example in
                      the diagram above: 50 BTC is split into two outputs of 0.5
                      BTC and 49.5 BTC, respectively. Though this architecture
                      provides the benefit of privacy, it does not scale very
                      well due to the need for many exhaustive cryptographic
                      operations to move even a small amount of coins. This is
                      because the minimum transaction amount per input is
                      0.00000001, which could result in the requirement for
                      thousands of inputs, each of which would require a
                      signature verification, increasing the size of the
                      transaction. A notable example of this is:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <a

                    <p>
                      As you can see from the above link, this transaction
                      consumed an entire Bitcoin block and was only moving
                      0.05569 BTC. If this were a common occurrence, Bitcoin
                      would only be able to process 1 transaction every ten
                      minutes. This is not the only example of the limitations
                      of the UTxO model, which creates inefficiency and serves
                      as a unique attack vector to any chain that employs it.

                      A Signature Chain is named as such due to it being a chain
                      of signatures and public keys, all linked together through
                      the next hash and previous transaction hash. Since this is
                      a consistent chain of events that cannot be altered, it
                      provides additional scaling benefits by requiring only two
                      signatures to verify an entire Sigchain: the first and
                      last transaction. This means that all the signatures in
                      between can be discarded along with the public keys,
                      saving a large amount of storage space without sacrificing
                      security. This is because a Sigchain is an immutable chain
                      of transactions A valid signature at the head transaction
                      of the chain proves that the entire chain is valid, as it
                      locks the entire Sigchain from modification.

                    <p>
                      Usually, this signature is the largest part of the
                      transaction, therefore removing the need to save it on
                      disk improves the scalability of the Nexus Blockchain. In
                      Bitcoin, the average input size is 186 bytes, with the
                      signature consuming 146 of these bytes, resulting in 77%
                      of the Bitcion blockchain being comprised of signatures
                      stored on disk. As you can see, signature chaining has a
                      huge impact on combating blockchain bloat.

                      An End Point Identifier (EID) is similar to an Internet
                      Protocol (IP) address, and is a form of identity on the
                      network layer. Through the use of LISP, the EID becomes
                      the identifier, while the RLOC (Routing Locator) becomes
                      the location. This decoupling enables a device to freely
                      roam between networks as only the RLOC changes, not the
                      EID. This is contrary to how the Internet currently
                      functions, where both the identifier and location are
                      bound together in a single IP address.

                    <p>
                      An EID is a critical security feature, as it can be linked
                      to a Sigchain which makes the network identifier
                      cryptographically associated with the Ledger. EIDs,
                      Sigchains and the use of reputation combined create an
                      elevated layer of trust to the Internet, as one can verify
                      with certainty that the other party is who they claim to
                      be without the need for third party services like
                      Certificate Authorities (CA). A reduction in fraud,
                      hacking, fake accounts, and identity theft for both

                      Sigchains increase resistance to attack by both classical
                      and theoretical quantum computers. This is achieved by
                      decoupling the identity of the account from the
                      cryptography associated with it, similar to how LISP
                      decouples the identifier and the location. This enables
                      the architectural advantage of changing the key pair that
                      is used to access the Sigchain with every transaction, and
                      hiding the public key until it is used. When an individual
                      creates a transaction on the network, they claim ownership
                      by revealing the public key of the NextHash (the hash of
                      the public key) by producing a valid signature from the
                      one time use private key. This significantly reduces the
                      time window for an attack to take place, naturally
                      increasing the required computing power to successfully
                      hijack a signature chain with MITM (Man in the Middle)
                      attacks. Please see Quantum Resistance for more
                      information.

                    <p>
                      Since the account identity is decoupled from the
                      cryptography, a Sigchain supports multiple signature
                      schemes such as FALCON (Fast Fourier Lattice-Based Compact
                      Signatures Over NTRU) or Brainpool. Due to FALCON being
                      still under study and assessment by NIST (National
                      Institute of Standards and Technology), it is generally
                      recommended that it is only used in production in what is
                      termed a ‘hybrid signature scheme’, meaning you don’t rely
                      solely on the security of FALCON for the security of the
                      system. In our implementation, a Sigchain acts like a
                      hybrid signature scheme, making use of FALCON safe for our
                      production environment.

                Quantum Resistance
              </h6>
              <p>
                With the rise in the power of classical computers and the
                emergence of quantum computers, public keys are becoming
                increasingly vulnerable. Most cryptocurrency addresses are
                created by hashing or obscuring the public key. Though, when a
                user makes a transaction the public key is revealed on the
                blockchain. In the realm of classical computing there is little
                risk with this method. However, a quantum computer running
                Shor’s algorithm could break most public key cryptography in
                little to no time, resulting in funds being stolen. Though most
                conjectures range from five to ten years before security could
                begin to break, Nexus has prepared by integrating a number of
                cryptographic innovations that support increased levels of
                quantum resistance.

                We have developed an architecture called Signature Chains that
                enhance the security of existing DSA (Digital Signature
                Algorithm), by hashing the public key until it is used while
                changing the key pair with every transaction. We have also
                integrated the following cryptographic functions: FALCON (a
                second round contender for the NIST Post-Quantum cryptography
                competition), Argon2 (winner of the password hashing
                competition, and a superior alternative to S-Crypt or B-Crypt),
                and Keccak (winner of the SHA3 competition).

                    Classical computing uses an array of transistors. These
                    transistors form the heart of your computer (the CPU). Each
                    transistor is capable of being either on or off, and these
                    states are used to represent the numerical values 1 and 0.
                    Binary digits’ (bits) number of states depends on the number
                    of transistors available, according to the formula (2^n) +
                    1, with n being the number of transistors. Classical
                    computers can only be in one of these states at any one
                    time, so the speed of your computer is limited to how fast
                    it can change state.

                    Quantum computers on the other hand, use what are termed
                    quantum bits or ‘qubits’ which are represented by the
                    quantum spin of electrons or photons. These particles are
                    placed into a state called superposition, allowing the qubit
                    to assume a value of 1 and 0 simultaneously, generally
                    resulting in an exponential increase in computational power
                    over their classical counterparts.

                    Nexus is accessible through technology we designed called
                    Signature Chains, a decentralized blockchain account that
                    allows you to login from any computer with a username,
                    password, and pin. They are comparable to a personal
                    blockchain that allows decentralized access through a login
                    system, removing the need to store a private key. Sigchains
                    deterministically create a mathematical ‘lock’ that only
                    your login credentials can unlock.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Fundamentally, a Sigchain decouples the private key from the
                    user account, therefore one is unbound by the possession or
                    security of a single private key. When one creates a
                    transaction on the network, they claim ownership by
                    revealing the public key of the NextHash (the hash of your
                    public key) and produce a signature from the one time use
                    private key. The private key becomes obsolete when the next
                    transaction is generated, producing higher levels of
                    security compared to the continual reuse of a private key,
                    as is the case with other blockchain technologies. The
                    future use of biometric username generation will strengthen
                    your credentials and Signature Chain access.

                    Signature Chains decouple keys from the user account,
                    meaning that at any time, you are able to change the type of
                    key that your account uses. This gives users the option to
                    use Post-Quantum cryptography such as FALCON, or the option
                    to use more time-tested Brainpool curves. If any flaws were
                    to be found in either of these cryptographic schemes, your
                    account would be safe using a signature chain. These
                    safeguards are important in order to protect systems over
                    time, as ongoing crypto-analysis are always finding
                    vulnerabilities and attack vectors that will begin to break
                    once secure cryptographic standards (eg. SHA1).

                    Complemented with this is the use of FALCON (Fast-Fourier
                    Lattice-Based Compact-Signatures Over NTRU) as an optional
                    setting, that uses Lattice Based cryptography to ensure the
                    security of accounts in the post-quantum age. The
                    computational requirements are at least 1/40th of Elliptic
                    Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), which means you
                    can verify signatures much faster than ECDSA. However, the
                    downside is that it requires about 1.5kb for both the public
                    key and signature. Though Falcon is based on aged and proven
                    mathematics (NTRU lattices), it has not undergone as much
                    crypto-analysis as Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) or

                    Is an open source password hashing function we have
                    integrated for key and username generation. Argon2 is a
                    memory-hard password hashing algorithm with variable
                    complexity which means it can control how many seconds it
                    takes to generate a key or username. This drastically
                    increases the time and resources it takes an offline hacker
                    to brute-force a Signature Chain. Because the time to
                    generate an Argon2 hash is bound by memory latency, a
                    specialized ‘password cracking’ device has no advantage over
                    a general purpose CPU.

                  <p>
                    Our default Argon2 settings requires at least 0.3 – 0.5
                    seconds to generate a new key, meaning one is only able to
                    try two to three passwords per second. Combining this with a
                    minimum requirement of at least 8 alphanumeric [a-Z, 0-9]
                    characters per password, even if the username and PIN were
                    known by the attacker, the time required to crack the
                    password would be in the order of 5 million years.

                    Due to the recommendation from NIST (National Institute for
                    Standards in Technology), the bit requirement for symmetric
                    encryption schemes and hash functions must be at least twice
                    the size for equivalent quantum resistance (eg. 512 vs 256).
                    This recommendation inspires our standard hash: 256-bits for

                    Nexus offers post quantum cryptography as an optional
                    feature to users, as at the moment ECC is still considered
                    safe. Our optional safeguards provide adequate levels of
                    resistance against attacks using a quantum computer. The
                    following will describe a MITM (Main-In-The-Middle) attack,
                    which is the only known attack able to penetrate a signature
                    chain if the user has not opted in to use FALCON (post
                    quantum cryptography).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A MITM attack can be described as someone eavesdropping on
                    node communication, and at the same time, relaying
                    information to other nodes, masquerading as the sender. In
                    order for this type of attack to take place, an attacker
                    would need to control the sigchain of every single node that
                    the user is connected to (i.e to compromise the private keys
                    of all connected nodes). This is because Nexus records a
                    hash in a sigchain’s crypto object register, that is a hash
                    of the certificate being used for SSL/TLS (Secure Socket
                    Layer / Transport Layer Security). This means that the
                    attacker has further difficulty pretending to be a remote
                    node, because the blockchain acts as a certificate authority
                    (CA).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On top of verifying certificates, nodes require additional
                    authentication before the network will accept their
                    transactions. The authentication message is signed by
                    another key in the crypto object register, which can be
                    facilitated by FALCON or Brainpool. In order to successfully
                    authenticate a connection as a MITM attacker, the attacker
                    would need to gain access to all the remote node’s
                    authentication keys.

                      >Note: * It is important to note that a replay attack
                      would not work in this case, due to the authentication
                      message containing a random session Nonce and timestamp
                      that even if intercepted cannot be used to fake
                      authentication.</em

                  <p>
                    Now, we will detail the steps of an attempted attack,
                    assuming the user has not configured their account to use
                    FALCON, and that the attacker is using a 3,800 qubit quantum
                    computer.
                  </p>
                  <ul class="list list-dot">
                    <li>
                      The MITM attacker needs to first: brute force a user's
                      certificate key or wait until the user's node sends it out
                      in a key exchange. They cannot create their own
                      self-signed certificate as in a normal MITM attack, since
                      the blockchain acts as a certificate authority (CA).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The attacker now needs to brute force the user's
                      authentication hash or again wait for an authentication
                      message, and attempt to break the authentication key.
                      Breaking this key would enable the attacker to forge
                      authentication messages, and thus pretend to be a node
                      that the user is connected to and trusts.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The attacker would then need to break the remote node's
                      authentication key (assuming they can forge signatures on
                      every open connection which is 16+ nodes, and that the
                      remote node is not already using FALCON).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The attacker would then need to wait for the user to
                      create a transaction, i.e for them to reveal their public
                      key, and in less than 200ms, break this public key in
                      order to forge transactions.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    This is a requirement, because to successfully hijack a
                    user’s account, the attacker would need to capture the
                    transaction before it was broadcast, brute force the
                    sender’s public key to obtain its private key, and then
                    broadcast a forged transaction to take over this user’s
                    account, all in less than 200ms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b><span>Why is the attack window only 200ms?</span></b>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The network considers the most valid transaction the one
                    that nodes receive first. With the internet round trip time
                    taking roughly 200ms, this is your upper bound of packet
                    propagation time. Therefore, in order to create a
                    conflicting transaction that could hijack a user’s signature
                    chain, the attacker would need their ‘attack’ transaction to
                    propagate over the network before the user’s transaction.
                    The window is only 200ms as the users transaction begins to
                    propagate at the time that the users public key is revealed,
                    making it highly improbable that any computer, including a
                    quantum computer, could ever break a user’s public key.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We believe that even when ECC is being used instead of
                    FALCON, the likelihood of a successful attack even by a
                    quantum computer is very unlikely. However, users that wish
                    to move away from ECC and switch to FALCON can do so with a
                    click of a button, and with little risk to their previous
                    transactions. This is because the keys that have already
                    been used in our Signature Chain architecture, no longer
                    have any use, and therefore can not be attacked.
