                The contract domain-specific language (DSL) is designed for
                users who are familiar with the command interface. It enables
                conditional contracts to be written directly into the API with
                the use of english words. This approach also allows people to be
                able to read or interpret contracts.

                Users pay the known cost of contract execution, which depends on
                the number of operations involved in the contract. The fee is
                calculated before the transaction is broadcast. This is a very
                different approach to Ethereum, where users are required to set
                a Gas limit, resulting in higher fees in times of increased
                network demand. This sometimes causes Ethereum contracts to
                fail, while the user still has to pay the contract costs.

                        The fee calculation for creating a token is based on the
                        number of total supply of token divisible units, which
                        in turn is calculated from the token supply and the
                        number of decimals in the token definition. For example,
                        a token with supply 1,000,000 and 2 decimals has a total
                        of 100,000,000 divisible units. The actual fee
                        calculation is a logarithmic scale based on this number,
                        using the formula:
                      </p>
                      <p>Fee = (log10(divisible units) â€“ 2) * 100</p>
                      <p>
                        A minimum fee of 1 NXS always applies. This yields the
                        following fees based on number of divisible units

                        A transaction fee is applied whenever a transaction is
                        created within 10 seconds of the last transaction within
                        a signature chain. The fee is calculated based on the
                        number of contracts within the transaction at a rate of
                        0.01 NXS

                        be between 0 and 1 NXS. The transaction fee is applied
